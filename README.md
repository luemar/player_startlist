# player_startlist
Presents a solution for a special case of the "SocialGolferProblem" (SGP) in creating startlists for 16 golf players,
playing in flights of 4, on 5 days/occations, each player playing another player only once, for a total of 20 flights
and startlists respectively. This solution can be used for 4 or 3 days/occations but all other constraints are fixed.  
Letters through to be replaced by players names.
